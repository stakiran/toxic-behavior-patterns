# Toxic Behavior Patterns
[Japanese](index.md) | [English](index_EN.md) | [GitHub](https://github.com/stakiran/toxic-behavior-patterns)

"Toxic Behavior Patterns" is a way to organize the "toxic behaviors" or "types of people" in a team that threaten your mental well-being. It's not universal enough to apply to every member of every team, but it should be accurate often enough to be useful.

A few notes:

- The context assumed by this document is not 0 to 1, but teamwork at 1 to 10 and beyond. In other words, assume a situation where things won't scale unless the contribution comes from the team rather than from a single individual
- Because it doesn't go as far as strict definitions, the team should align on what each term means. For example, in the Brilliant Jerk section it says "an unpleasant person," but it doesn't define what "unpleasant" means. You should create a simple definition that anyone on the team can immediately agree with. Otherwise, Toxic Behavior Patterns could become a justification for bullying or an obstacle to diversity
- There aren't many options for dealing with these patterns: expulsion (kicking them out of the team), isolation (keeping them contained and quiet), and special treatment (creating a different way of dealing with them and steering them into that)

## Brilliant Jerk (too harsh)
Someone who is highly capable but unpleasant. It's a concept originating at Netflix and is well-known in the software development world.

Netflix defines it as "behavior that undermines teamwork." Examples include intimidating speech and actions, public-shaming feedback (giving direct negative feedback in front of others), slander, and other harassment-level tones and phrasing. In any case, their behavior is sharp enough to be called an "attack."

As for how to handle it, you should basically expel them. Because Brilliant Jerks are competent, they tend to be proud, and it's almost impossible for them to adopt a perspective where they reform themselves. Which means constructive dialogue isn't possible. The impact can be large enough to cause multiple resignations, so you should treat it as a critical issue and work toward expulsion.

If you can't expel them, aim for isolation first. Stop letting the Brilliant Jerk communicate with n people, and have them do so through a single representative instead. In other words, the representative serves as an umbrella to protect the team. You can also remove their decision-making authority and place them in an advisor role, or switch from face-to-face to asynchronous text communication. In any case, by easing the amount of direct communication even a little, you can guide things toward isolation.

## Alien Sense (too incomprehensible)
This refers to someone whose values or knowledge level is so far removed that it evokes a visceral sense of fear.

Someone with Alien Sense casually brings in concepts that nobody on the team knows. They bring up academic-sounding terms from fields like philosophy or economics, strongly insist on borrowed influencer phrases, or suddenly introduce their own definitions and neologisms. In fact, at that point, teamwork has already collapsed. If the receiving members continue the discussion without knowing those concepts, they can't understand; but if the person explains from scratch, it becomes long and unwieldy. One principle of teamwork is a shared language—using established vocabulary and language. In short, the Alien brings in language outside the shared language.

The response is to encourage the Alien to use the shared language. If that fixes it, fine. If it doesn't, it's better to "promote" them to Brilliant Jerk and move toward isolation or removal. However, since they aren't as overtly aggressive as a Brilliant Jerk, they can often still be used as a productive force if you consider their role and how you communicate with them. You'll probably need some kind of "special treatment" different from ordinary members. It's good if you have enough diversity to hold and execute that idea. If you don't, the Alien is almost synonymous with a "quiet Brilliant Jerk."

## Exposer (oversharing)
Someone who broadcasts too much information, including self-disclosure.

This is common among people deeply immersed in the internet, open source, influencer activities, and the like. They want to make public all kinds of information related to work, and they also want to disclose all kinds of information about themselves. For example, they might come out about minority traits when meeting for the first time, publish meeting minutes or results from an n-person meeting without permission, or prefer talking in a channel visible to everyone rather than in a private chat.

Exposers make members feel the following anxieties:

- What if my information gets exposed too...
- Since this person shares so much, do I have to share more too...
- Will this person's level become the new "normal"? Will the costly work of broadcasting information be institutionalized as a future task...

The response is to first put into words the appropriate balance of information disclosure and self-disclosure. Whether an Exposer is good or bad depends on the team's situation; the Exposer isn't inherently bad. It's bad because they don't fit the team's situation and they lean too far into oversharing.

Therefore, first articulate the team's situation, and then clarify what is acceptable and what is not. Unless you do that, the Exposer won't settle down—because being an Exposer isn't inherently bad. If anything, it can even be excellent as a modern view of work. For a Slack-using team, "Write it in the channel because DMs aren't trackable and they get political" is something you can agree with. But even so, if someone suddenly does a sensitive coming-out in a channel, it's a problem (it causes major agitation and confusion within the team). Balance matters, and to know the balance you need to articulate the current reality. You must not skimp on this effort.

After that, if they still don't respect the team's balance, judge it as harmful and move toward expulsion.

## Low Capacity (too slow)
Someone who hasn't reached the capability or knowledge level the team assumes. This doesn't mean they're new and lack domain or teamwork experience; it means they fundamentally lack processing ability or the level of knowledge. For example, if a team made up only of University of Tokyo graduates (top-tier academic competitiveness in Japan) includes someone who graduated from a university with a deviation score of 40, the gap may be so large that they likely can't keep up.

When there's a disparity in capability or knowledge, Toxic Behavior is more likely to occur. If only the Toxic is high, it becomes a Brilliant Jerk; conversely, the case where only the Toxic is low is this Low Capacity pattern.

With Low Capacity, team members have to "wait." Or, to prevent the burden from spreading to everyone, the team may set a representative for communication with the Low Capacity person, creating a structure where only that representative keeps bearing the load. Either way, equal and healthy communication can't be established.

The way to deal with it is to take the Low Capacity person out of the category of "members who can do conventional communication" and establish another way for them to contribute. There's no point if the representative bears the load; the Low Capacity person must be able to act autonomously and contribute. If that's not possible, you end up moving toward expelling them from the team. They're not as villainous as a Brilliant Jerk, and if you clumsily push expulsion it can turn into a bullying dynamic, so you must proceed carefully. You'll probably visualize the performance shortfall and guide things so that the Low Capacity person leaves on their own.

## Ignorer (too much read-but-no-reply or unread)
An Ignorer is someone who doesn't react or reply in written communication. There are cases where they don't even read it, and cases where they do read it but consistently ignore it.

You could also call an Ignorer a Low Capacity case in terms of reading and writing skills. Ignorers only accept verbal communication and, even for things that could be done asynchronously in writing, they repeatedly want conversations and meetings. To other members, they look like someone who requires "caregiving," because you have to schedule meetings every time or design opportunities for conversation.

Ignorers also often have problems with task management. In other words, they can't read and write because their own task management has collapsed, yet they set that aside and demand verbal communication. The real problem is that their task management is broken; they should make task management work and create time and rhythm for reading and writing.

For an Ignorer, the response is isolation. It would be good if you could train their reading/writing and task management skills, but like Brilliant Jerks, Ignorers tend to be proud. They're numbed by success experiences based on verbal communication, so they loathe the gritty, steady practices of reading/writing and task management. Training them is probably impossible. The moment someone like this is on the team, they become a bottleneck, so you isolate them—build a system where decisions and other work can proceed without them.

On the other hand, because Ignorers are often capable, as with Aliens, you should also proactively consider a path where you keep them alive through special treatment. However, you should stop approaches like "everyone participates," which obstruct the team, and protect the team by appointing a representative. Or you can rotate the representative role. With this approach, you can still let the Ignorer interact with everyone. Verbal communication is also a human practice and is easy to justify; precisely for that reason, the Ignorer is a troublesome Toxic. Teams that already have mature asynchronous written communication must not compromise on dealing with Ignorers.

## Headless (too inflexible)
Someone so inflexible that they never step outside conventions (implicit rules) and customs (implicit culture). The name comes from not having a head to think for themselves; you could also say they are strongly obedient to the team or organization. They cannot adopt the perspective of deviating from what has been implicitly prescribed.

Headless people are valued in static, predetermined work or in bureaucratic worlds, but in other teams they often become Toxic. For approaches, ways of thinking, and ways of being that don't fit conventions or customs, you have to think with your own head and, if needed, take the risk of acting—but Headless people can't do that. Either the idea of doing it doesn't exist, or even if they understand it intellectually, they won't do it out of self-preservation. What's troublesome is that, to avoid being seen for what they are, on the surface they perform seriousness and mildness.

To judge whether someone is Headless, look at their actions:

- Suppose the team uses Notion, and you decide to introduce Notion AI to make various tasks easier. You actually introduce it, and all that's left is for each person to try it. A Headless person probably won't use it. They likely won't even access the page that announces and discusses introducing Notion AI
- Suppose one member posts a proposal, and it's on a page where access can be tracked. Normally, people would read it and leave a footprint. Or, if they decide that the proposal has no value, there may be no footprint, but even then they'd have left one "before deciding," and depending on their mood a footprint might appear. In contrast, a Headless person doesn't access it at all—so much so that no footprint is ever left

The most troublesome thing is that Headless traits are the majority. It depends on the company, but in large enterprises—not just 1 to 10, but 10 to 100 or 100 to 1000—it's not uncommon to find yourself in a situation where everyone except you is Headless. In that case, you, the non-Headless one, become the Toxic.

From here on, assume a team where there's one Headless person, or only a small number. The response for Headless is special treatment. Being inflexible also means they can steadily execute work, so it's good to give them operational, task-like work. Conversely, deep work involving exploration, decision-making, or self-disclosure becomes "caregiving" if they're present (the Low Capacity structure), so it's better if they're not there. A common anti-pattern is to always include all team members; the more Headless people you have, the less productive that gathering becomes.
